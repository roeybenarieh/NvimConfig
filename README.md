## what the f**ck is this repo about?

You probably used vscode/pycharm, and you are asking yourself what is the point of life? Why am I being drag down by this IDE ðŸ˜ž <br>

Say hello to RoeyLazyVim! The only IDE that doesn't make you shoot yourself in the foot while you're using it. It has everything you used to and even more! <br>

Already have some experience with vi/vim? Great! This IDE is just for you!
## I'm stack, what should I do?
If you want to do anything, there is a good chance it's already supported by the IDE. <br>
A few tricks to find staff you want to do:

- type \<leader>sk (\<leader> is the space key), this will give you a interface to search for keymaps
- search online, there is a large Neovim community at you command!
- read the LazyVim documentation given above, it might help you understand if what you want already exists, and if not how to add it (and create a PRðŸ˜Š)

## TODO
- make key maps for navigating in insert mode
- make more key maps for gitsigns
- make jbyuki/one-small-step-for-vimkind work
- undo file tree changes like deleting, moving, renaming files.(maybe venv-local-history)
- install plugins: LLM capability, gitlab integrations, overseer.nvim
- handle big files
- keymap for opening showing deleted files from mini.files
- allow NeoTree to delete files(and move them to the trash) 
- make NeoTest find test files from the project's root path(not only if it's open in buffer)
